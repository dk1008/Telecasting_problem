# Telecasting_problem

#Something to Watch

Youâ€™re given n shows, each with a fixed start time (s) and an end time (e). Each show is telecasted on a different channel. Find the total duration during which at least one show is being telecasted.


#Constraints
1 <= t <= 10^3

1 <= n<= 10^4

1 <= e - s (in seconds) <= 24 * 60 * 60


Time format is a 24 hour clock with start of the day as 00:00:00 and end as 24:00:00.


#Input Format

The first line contains a single integer t, denoting the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of shows (and channels). 
Following n lines contains the start s and end e for each show space separated.

#Output Format

For each test case print the total duration.
